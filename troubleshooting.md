### Troubleshooting and Debugging

Troubleshooting is an essential skill for system administrators, as it helps identify and resolve issues quickly to ensure system stability and availability. This section covers common troubleshooting techniques and debugging tools in RHEL-based systems.

#### 1. **Diagnosing Boot and Kernel Issues**

Issues during boot-up or kernel panics are often the result of misconfigurations, hardware problems, or software failures. Here's how to diagnose and resolve boot-related issues:

##### Checking Boot Logs:

Use `journalctl` to view logs related to system boot-up:
```bash
journalctl -b
```

This will show logs from the current boot session.

##### Viewing Kernel Logs:

For kernel-related messages, you can use:
```bash
dmesg | less
```

or

```bash
journalctl -k
````

##### Booting into Rescue Mode:

If the system does not boot normally, you can boot into rescue mode (single-user mode) by modifying the boot parameters in GRUB:
1. Reboot the system.
2. When GRUB appears, select the kernel you want to boot and press `e`.
3. Find the line starting with `linux` and append `single` to the end of the line.
4. Press `Ctrl+x` to boot into rescue mode.

In rescue mode, you can perform diagnostics and fix configuration issues.

#### 2. **Network Connectivity Issues**

Network issues can be caused by incorrect configurations, firewall settings, or network interface problems. Here's how to troubleshoot:

##### Checking Network Interface Status:

Use `ip` or `ifconfig` to check the status of network interfaces:
```bash
ip a
```

or

```bash
ifconfig
```

##### Testing Connectivity with `ping`:

To test basic network connectivity, use the `ping` command:
```bash
ping google.com
```

To test connectivity to a local network:
```bash
ping <local-ip-address>
```

##### Tracing the Network Path with `traceroute`:

If you are having trouble reaching a remote server, use `traceroute` to trace the network path:
```bash
traceroute google.com
```

##### Checking DNS Resolution:

If you can’t resolve domain names, check your DNS settings:
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

You can also test DNS resolution with `nslookup` or `dig`:
```bash
nslookup google.com
```

#### 3. **Identifying Performance Bottlenecks**

Performance issues often arise from resource constraints, such as CPU, memory, or disk. Here are some tools for diagnosing performance bottlenecks:

##### Checking System Load:

Use `top` or `htop` to get an overview of system load and resource usage:
```bash
top
```

or

```bash
htop
```

##### Checking Memory Usage:

Use `free` to check memory usage:
```bash
free -h
```

If memory usage is high, you can identify the processes consuming the most memory with:
```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
```

##### Checking CPU Usage:

To check which processes are consuming CPU, use:
```bash
top -o %CPU
```

You can also use `mpstat` from the `sysstat` package to check CPU utilization:
```bash
mpstat -P ALL 1
````

##### Disk I/O Issues:

If disk performance is a concern, use `iostat` to check disk usage:
```bash
iostat -xz 1
```

#### 4. **System Logs and Log Files**

Logs are invaluable when troubleshooting issues. Here’s how to access key logs:

##### Viewing System Logs:

Use `journalctl` to view the system journal:
```bash
journalctl
```

To view logs for a specific service:
```bash
journalctl -u <service-name>
```

##### Viewing Specific Log Files:

Some key log files you may find useful:

- **System logs**: `/var/log/messages`
- **Authentication logs**: `/var/log/secure`
- **Kernel logs**: `/var/log/kern.log`
- **Application logs**: `/var/log/<application-name>.log`

To view logs in real-time, use `tail`:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages
```

#### 5. **Service Failures**

If a service fails to start or crashes, you can diagnose the issue using `systemctl` and `journalctl`.

##### Checking the Status of a Service:

To check the status of a service:
```bash
systemctl status <service-name>
```

##### Restarting a Service:

To restart a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart <service-name>
```

##### Viewing Service Logs:

Use `journalctl` to view logs for a specific service:
```bash
journalctl -u <service-name>
```

#### 6. **File System Issues**

File system corruption or issues with mounting/unmounting file systems can lead to problems. Here's how to troubleshoot:

##### Checking File System Health:

To check the health of a filesystem, use `fsck` (File System Consistency Check). For example:
```bash
sudo fsck /dev/sda1
```

##### Mounting Issues:

If a filesystem is not mounting properly, check the `/etc/fstab` file to ensure the configuration is correct.

To manually mount a filesystem:
```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

#### 7. **Memory Dumps and Crash Analysis**

If the system crashes or experiences a kernel panic, you can analyze memory dumps to identify the root cause.

##### Enabling Kernel Crash Dumps:

To configure kernel crash dumps, install the `kexec-tools` package:
```bash
sudo dnf install kexec-tools
```

##### Viewing Crash Dumps:

Once configured, crash dumps will be stored in `/var/crash/`. Use `crash` to analyze the dump:
```bash
crash /var/crash/vmcore
```

#### 8. **Using `strace` for Debugging**

`strace` is a powerful tool for tracing system calls and signals in a process. This can help debug application crashes or performance issues.

##### Tracing a Running Process:

To trace a running process:
```bash
strace -p <pid>
```

##### Starting a Command with `strace`:

To trace a command:
```bash
strace command
```

#### 9. **Using `gdb` for Application Debugging**

`gdb` is a debugger for analyzing application crashes and bugs.

##### Starting `gdb`:

To start `gdb` with a core dump or executable:
```bash
gdb <executable> <core-dump>
```

##### Debugging a Process:

To attach `gdb` to a running process:
```bash
gdb -p <pid>
```
